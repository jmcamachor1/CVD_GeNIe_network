# CVD GeNIe network



This repository contains a .xdsl with a GeNIe of the model implemented in the paper **A predictive Bayesian network model for cardiovascular risk factors**. We used [GeNIe academic version](https://www.bayesfusion.com/downloads/) to build the network; hence the use of this file is limited to educational purposes.
